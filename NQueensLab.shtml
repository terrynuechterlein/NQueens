<p> In this lab you will implement the N Queens Problem, using the <code>BoundedGrid</code> 
  class.<sup>&#8225;</sup> 
  In this lab you will implement an algorithm that places N queens on an N x N 
  board (like a chess board) in such a way that no queen can attack another queen.</p>

<h4>Exercise Set</h4>
          
        <ol>
          <li>Download the zip file that contains the starting code files for 
            the N Queens Lab (<code><a href="NQueens.zip">NQueens.zip</a></code>) 
            and unzip it.  When you unzip the file you will see the
following files and folders. 
             <ul>
            <li>The file <code><a
href="NQueensLab.shtml">NQueensLab.shtml</a></code> contains this
write-up.   
            <li>Two image files, <code>GoldCrown.gif</code> and
<code>SilverCrown.gif</code> (images of crowns).
            <li>The <code>grid.jar</code> Java archive
(<code>jar</code>) file
                  contains a library of classes that can be used to
model a two-dimensional grid as described above.
                <ul>
                  <li><code>BoundedGrid</code> (class that represents
the two-dimensional grid)<sup>&#8225;</sup></li>
                  <li><code>Location</code> (class that represents the
row and column positions of a location in the 
grid)<sup>&#8225;</sup></li>
                  <li><code>ColorBlock</code> (class whose objects
represent blocks of color put in a grid)</li>
                </ul>
             The documentation for these files can be found by
downloading the 
<a href="http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/GridPkgClassDocs.zip">GridPkgClassDocs.zip</a> file.
                       </li>
          <p></p>
	    <li>The <code>JavaSourceFiles</code> folder contains the
source files for the NQueens Lab.
            <ul>
              <li><code>NQueensLab</code> (contains the <code>main</code> method)</li>
              <li><code>NQueens</code> (the class that implements the solution 
                to the N Queens Problem) </li>
              <li><code>Queen</code> (represents a queen on the board)</li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Note: All of the
            classes in the <code>JavaSourceFiles</code> folder and the
<code>grid.jar</code> Java archive file are covered by the <a
href="/License.txt">GNU General Public License.</a>
          </ul>
            <p> </p>
          <li>Compile and run the program. You should see an 8 x 8 &quot;chess 
            board&quot; with no queens. 
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li>Complete the <code>numQueens</code> and <code>removeQueen</code> 
            methods, without adding any additional instance variables.&nbsp; To 
            test the <code>removeQueen</code> method, modify the <code>placeQueen</code> 
            method to add a queen to any arbitrary column (your choice) of the 
            correct row for that queen, display the environment, and then remove 
            the queen and redisplay the environment.&nbsp; Modify the <code>solve</code> 
            method to place one queen.&nbsp; Run the program.&nbsp; You should 
            see one queen (or color block) appear and then disappear from the 
            environment. 
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li>Modify the <code>placeQueen</code> method to recursively place all 
            the queens in arbitrary columns (or the same arbitrary column).&nbsp; 
            Think about where you should place the recursive call if you want 
            to see the queens appear in each row, one-by-one, and then disappear 
            in reverse order.&nbsp; Make sure you remember to include a base case.&nbsp; 
            Do you need to modify the <code>solve</code> method to place all the 
            queens?&nbsp; If so, do it. 
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li>Fully implement the <code>placeQueen</code> method so that it checks 
            column by column to find an OK location to place this queen, until 
            the queen has been successfully placed in a column and all the queens 
            after her have been successfully placed also.&nbsp; Since the <code>locationIsOK</code> 
            method always returns <code>true</code>, the queens should fill in 
            the first column. 
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li>Modify the <code>locationIsOK</code> method to return <code>false</code> 
            if any queens have already be placed in the same column as the location 
            parameter.&nbsp; When you have this working you should see the queens 
            fill in the diagonal from location (0, 0) to location (n-1, n-1). 
            <p> </p>
          </li>
          <li>Modify the <code>locationIsOK</code> method again to also return 
            <code>false</code> if any queens have already been placed on the board 
            in locations that are on the diagonal from the location parameter. 
          </li>
        </ol>
